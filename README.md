## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Master's student in **AI & ML** focused on building real, production-oriented AI systems — not just notebooks.

I work at the intersection of:
- LLM Applications
- RAG Architectures
- AI Agents
- Financial Data Automation
- Document Intelligence
- MLOps foundations

I believe AI should not just *work* — it should be **robust, scalable, and automated end-to-end.**

```python
class ShivrajPatare:

    def __init__(self):
        self.role = "AI / ML Engineer (Masters Student)"
        self.builds = [
            "LLM + RAG Systems",
            "AI Agents",
            "Financial Data Pipelines",
            "Document AI Workflows"
        ]
        self.stack_preference = "Free & Open Source"
        self.mindset = "Automate everything. Make it production-ready."
    
    def philosophy(self):
        return "Strong systems. Clear thinking. Real-world impact."
```

## 📈 What Makes Me Different

I don’t just train models.  
I build **complete systems**:

Data Ingestion → Processing → LLM Reasoning → Structured Output → Deployment.

My goal is simple:
Build AI systems that are practical, efficient, and deployable.
